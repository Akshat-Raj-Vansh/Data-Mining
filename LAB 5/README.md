# Question

    1. Construct a scatterplot with x-axis to be the mass variable and y-axis to be the age variable.
    Moreover, determine the color of the points based on the class of the candidate (0 or 1).
    2. Create a distance matrix for the data.
    3. Make a hierarchical clustering analysis using the single linkage method. Then create an object
    that contains only two clusters.
    4. Make a hierarchical clustering analysis using the complete linkage method. Then create an
    object that contains only two clusters.
    5. Construct the trees that are produced by Questions 2 and 3 and draw the two clusters (at the
    plots).
    6. Construct two scatterplot with x-axis to be the mass variable and y-axis to be the age variable.
    Moreover, determine the color of the points based on the cluster that those points belong to.
    Each scatterplot is for different clustering method.
    7. Construct a scatterplot with x-axis to be the mass variable and y-axis to be the age variable.
    Moreover, determine the color of the points based on the cluster (retrieved from k-mean
    method) that those points belong to.
    8. Construct a scatterplot with x-axis to be the mass variable and y-axis to be the age variable.
    Moreover, determine the color of the points based on the cluster (retrieved from k-median
    method) that those points belong to.
